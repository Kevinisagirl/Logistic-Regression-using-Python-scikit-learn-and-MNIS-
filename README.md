# Logistic-Regression-using-Python-scikit-learn-and-MNIST-dataset

This project is based on https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-using-python-sklearn-numpy-mnist-handwriting-recognition-matplotlib-a6b31e2b166a by Michael Galarnyk

The goal is to be able to classify the MNIST handwritten digits using logistic regression following this tutorial and then create features to improve the results.
